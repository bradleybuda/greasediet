greasediet
==========

A greasemonkey script to make life a little bit easier on
thelinediet.com.  Right now it does export to CSV.  Someday it might
do other things.

How To Use
----------

1. Get Firefox from http://firefox.com
2. Install Greasemonkey from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748
3. Install this script from http://github.com/bradleybuda/greasediet/raw/master/src/greasediet.user.js
4. Go visit http://thelinediet.com and log in.  You should see an "Export Data" button.
5. Click it! Do it! Do it!
6. Save the file, rename it to a .csv, and open in your editor of choice (try Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers).

TODOs
-----

* Nicer filename on downloaded file
* Clean up timestamps to play nice with excel
* Other, non-CSV-related goodies
